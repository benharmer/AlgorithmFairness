# AlgorithmFairness
The project's aim is twofold: firstly, comparing the "fairness" of popular machine learning algorithms - logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests and Naive Bayes, and secondly, studying the effectiveness of two pre-processing techniques - Suppression and Reweighing. 

The code will also output whether the algorithm satisfies five measures of fairness: statistical parity, equalised opportunity, equalised odds and the p% rule. 
The data produced is used for analysis in my Operational Research MSc dissertation: "Modelling and Measuring the Fairness of Artifical Intelligence Algorithms".
